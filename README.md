# dom-utility
A custom DOM utility for a browser environment. Provides methods which will be familiar to users of jQuery.

This is the code accompanying my series of blog posts on building your own DOM utility:

[Build your own DOM utility Part 1](http://davidbanks.co.nz/post/build-your-own-dom-utility-part-1)

[Build your own DOM utility Part 2](http://davidbanks.co.nz/post/build-your-own-dom-utility-part-2)

[Build your own DOM utility Part 3](http://davidbanks.co.nz/post/build-your-own-dom-utility-part-3)

Provides these methods:

- text()
- html()
- attr()
- prop()
- hasClass()
- addClass()
- removeClass()
- toggleClass()
- parent()
- children()
- find()
- remove()
- append()
- prepend()
- css()
- data()
- on()

I hope to add better documentation here soon - in the meantime you can check out my blog posts which discuss each method.
